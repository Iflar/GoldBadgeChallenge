I’m putting this little note in here to let the grader know that this last challenge was not exactly

given maximum effort - I was unable to figure out how to get my DisplayAll method to work the

way I would have liked… Due to this (In conjunction with the fact that this was purely an extra challenge)

I decided to treat this challenge as more of a refresher on a few of the fundamentals…

and as such, am not really concerned with the grade on this one in particular.
